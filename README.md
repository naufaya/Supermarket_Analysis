# 🌟 Supermarket Customer Analysis 🌟
Final Project Modul 2 for Data Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Supermarket Customer Analysis** project! 🛒 This project dives deep into customer behavior, spending habits, and how they interact with various products and promotions. The ultimate goal? To help our supermarket shine brighter by boosting profits through smarter, data-driven strategies! 💡

## 📂 What's Inside?

Here's what you'll find in this repository:

- **🧹 Data Cleaning (Supermarket).ipynb**: This notebook is where the magic of data cleaning happens! We handle missing values, create cool new columns like `Children`, `Total_Spending`, `Total_Purchases`, `Campaign Accepted`, and `Avg_spend`, and get the data all set for some serious analysis. ✨

- **🗃️ Supermarket_Cleaning.csv**: The star of the show—the cleaned dataset! Ready for analysis and exploration, it includes all the original data plus the new features we created. 🌟

- **📊 Data Analysis (Supermarket).ipynb**: This notebook is where we dig into the data to uncover hidden treasures! We explore customer behaviors, spending trends, and their responses to different promotions. 🔍

## 🔍 Key Insights

Here's a sneak peek at what we discovered:

1. **👶 Customer Behavior & Children**:
    - **Insight**: Customers without children are living their best lives with more disposable income, spending more on average. 💸 Time to pitch those premium products their way!

2. **💳 Total Spending & Purchases**:
    - **Insight**: The more they shop, the more they spend! 🛍️ Encouraging repeat purchases could be the golden ticket to higher profits.

3. **🎯 Campaign Acceptance**:
    - **Insight**: Campaign 4? It's a hit! 🎯 It drove up average spending like a pro. We should definitely consider what made it special and apply those lessons elsewhere.

4. **💡 Average Purchase Insights**:
    - **Insight**: Married customers and those with kiddos tend to splurge more frequently. Time to craft some special deals just for them! 👫👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
